    text: "# Visa & Entry Requirements for Indonesia\n\nIndonesia offers various visa options for travelers depending on the purpose and duration of your visit. Here's everything you need to know about entering this beautiful archipelago.\n\n## Visa-Free Access\n\nCitizens from over 160 countries can visit Indonesia visa-free for tourism purposes for up to 30 days. This visa-free stay cannot be extended and is strictly for tourism purposes only. Always check the latest list of eligible countries before planning your trip.\n\n## Visa on Arrival (VoA)\n\nIf you require more flexibility, the Visa on Arrival option is available for citizens of 86 countries. The VoA costs USD $35 and is valid for 30 days. One of the advantages of the VoA is that it can be extended once for an additional 30 days without leaving the country.\n\n## E-Visa\n\nIndonesia now offers an electronic visa application system allowing visitors to apply online before their trip. The e-Visa processing typically takes 3-5 business days, and approval notifications are sent via email.\n\n## Required Documents\n\n- Passport with at least 6 months validity from your intended date of entry\n- Return or onward ticket proving your intention to leave Indonesia\n- Proof of sufficient funds for your stay (approximately USD $100 per day)\n- Completed arrival/departure card (provided during your flight or at the airport)\n\n## Special Permits\n\nIf you plan to visit restricted areas like Papua, you'll need to obtain a special permit (surat jalan) from Indonesian authorities. Application should be made well in advance of your travel.\n\n## COVID-19 Requirements\n\nIndonesia has updated its COVID-19 entry requirements. While vaccination is no longer mandatory for all travelers, some health protocols may still be in place. Check the latest health requirements before traveling.\n\n## Overstaying Penalties\n\nOverstaying your visa in Indonesia results in a fine of IDR 1,000,000 (approximately USD $70) per day. Severe cases of overstaying may result in detention, deportation, and being blacklisted from future entry.\n\n## Visa Extensions\n\nVisa extensions can be processed at the local immigration office (Kantor Imigrasi). The process typically takes 3-5 working days, and you should begin the extension process at least 7 days before your current visa expires.\n\n## Business and Other Visas\n\nFor business purposes, social-cultural visits, or other non-tourism activities, different visa categories apply. These typically require a sponsor in Indonesia and additional documentation.\n\nAlways check with the nearest Indonesian Embassy or Consulate for the most up-to-date visa information before planning your trip to Indonesia.",

      "A guide to Indonesian cultural etiquette, including how to greet, dress, etiquette in places of worship, dining customs, and cultural taboos for polite interaction.",
    text: '# Cultural Etiquette in Indonesia\n\nIndonesia is a diverse nation with hundreds of ethnic groups, each with their own customs. Understanding and respecting local cultural etiquette will enhance your experience and show appreciation for your hosts.\n\n## Greetings & Interactions\n\n### The Proper Greeting\n\nThe traditional Indonesian greeting is a gentle handshake with a slight nod or bow. Between Muslims, it\'s common to touch the hand to the heart after shaking hands as a sign of sincerity.\n\n### Using Names\n\nMany Indonesians, especially Javanese, may not use family names. Address people using their title and first name: "Mr. Budi" or "Ibu (Mrs.) Siti." Using "Pak" (for men) and "Ibu" (for women) followed by their name is respectful.\n\n### Physical Contact\n\nPublic displays of affection are frowned upon. Even hugging or touching someone of the opposite gender may be inappropriate in more conservative areas. When in doubt, follow the locals\' lead.\n\n## Body Language & Gestures\n\n- **The Right Hand**: Use your right hand for giving, receiving, eating, or touching others. The left hand is considered unclean in many Indonesian cultures.\n- **Pointing**: Avoid pointing with your index finger; instead, gesture with your thumb or an open hand.\n- **Head**: The head is considered sacred in many Indonesian cultures. Avoid touching someone\'s head, even children\'s.\n- **Feet**: Feet are considered unclean. Don\'t point your feet at people or religious objects, and don\'t show the soles of your feet.\n\n## Dress Code\n\n### General Guidelines\n\nIndonesians generally dress modestly. In major cities like Jakarta, Western clothing is common, but in rural areas and during religious occasions, more conservative attire is expected.\n\n### Religious Sites\n\nWhen visiting temples, mosques, or other religious sites:\n- Cover your shoulders and knees\n- Remove shoes before entering\n- Women may need to cover their hair in mosques\n- Some temples provide sarongs for visitors\n\n## Temple Etiquette\n\n- Walk clockwise around temples when possible\n- Don\'t stand higher than religious statues or shrines\n- Ask permission before taking photos, especially of ceremonies\n- Speak quietly and be respectful of worshippers\n- Women who are menstruating should not enter certain temple areas in Bali\n\n## Dining Customs\n\n- Wait to be invited to eat or for the host to say "Silakan makan" (Please eat)\n- It\'s polite to accept food or drinks when offered\n- Leaving a small amount of food on your plate signals you\'re satisfied\n- In more traditional settings, meals may be eaten with the right hand\n- If using your hand to eat, use only your right hand\n\n## Gift Giving\n\n- When visiting an Indonesian home, bringing a small gift is appreciated\n- Avoid giving alcohol in Muslim households\n- Gifts are typically opened in private, not in front of the giver\n- Wrapped gifts should use bright, happy colors (avoid white, which is associated with funerals)\n\n## Religious Considerations\n\nIndonesia is home to the world\'s largest Muslim population, but also has significant Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, and indigenous religious communities.\n\n- During Ramadan, be respectful by not eating, drinking, or smoking in public during daylight hours\n- On Nyepi (Balinese Day of Silence), visitors must remain inside their accommodations\n- Friday is the Muslim holy day, with afternoon prayers being particularly important\n\n## Common Cultural Taboos\n\n- Losing your temper or raising your voice in public\n- Criticizing the government, religion, or local customs\n- Touching someone\'s shoulder or back when speaking to them (especially for opposite genders)\n- Taking photographs during religious ceremonies without permission\n\n## Communication Style\n\nIndonesians often communicate indirectly and may avoid saying "no" directly to maintain harmony. "Yes" might sometimes mean "I hear you" rather than "I agree." Pay attention to non-verbal cues and be patient in communications.\n\n## Regional Variations\n\nEtiquette can vary significantly between different Indonesian islands and ethnic groups. What\'s acceptable in cosmopolitan Jakarta might not be in rural Sumatra or traditional Bali. Research specific regional customs for the areas you plan to visit.\n\nBy respecting Indonesian cultural practices, you\'ll create more meaningful connections and have a richer travel experience across the archipelago.',
